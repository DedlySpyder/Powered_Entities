[mod-setting-description]
Powered_Entities_00_manual_mode=Manual mode requires you to make power pads for each entity to be powered, while turning this off will automatically have entities connect to the power grid
Powered_Entities_01_minimum_wire_reach=This will force powered entities to only have enough wire reach to hit another like entity directly next to it (Example: an assembling machine will only have enough wire reach to hit an assembler right next to it (to each side))
Powered_Entities_00_enable_inserter=This will include inserters from being wired through this mod
Powered_Entities_01_enable_solar=This will include solar panels to be wired through this mod
Powered_Entities_02_enable_accumulator=This will include accumulators to be wired through this mod
Powered_Entities_30_recalculate_show=Show/Hide the recalulate powered entities button
Powered_Entities_40_recalculate_batch_size=Number of chunks to recalculate each tick, larger batches will increase the load on the game, but make the whole process not take as long (A recalculate is run when the Powered Entities technology is researched or when another mod is added/upgraded/removed from the save)

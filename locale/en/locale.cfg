[mod-setting-description]
Powered_Entities_00_manual_mode=Manual mode requires you to make power pads for each entity to be powered, while turning this off will automatically have entities connect to the power grid
Powered_Entities_01_minimum_wire_reach=This will force powered entities to only have enough wire reach to hit another like entity directly next to it (Example: an assembling machine will only have enough wire reach to hit an assembler right next to it (to each side))
Powered_Entities_00_enable_inserter=This will include inserters from being wired through this mod
Powered_Entities_05_enable_solar=This will include solar panels to be wired through this mod
Powered_Entities_10_enable_accumulator=This will include accumulators to be wired through this mod
Powered_Entities_15_enable_producers=This will include producer entities to be wired through this mod (such as steam engines and turbines)
Powered_Entities_80_recalculate_show=Show/Hide the recalulate powered entities button
Powered_Entities_90_recalculate_batch_size=Number of chunks to recalculate each tick, larger batches will increase the load on the game, but make the whole process not take as long (A recalculate is run when the Powered Entities technology is researched or when another mod is added/upgraded/removed from the save)
Powered_Entities_skip_recalculate_on_mod_changes=This setting will skip the recalculate entities when another mod is upgraded or removed. This may leave invisible power poles around the map. Manually recalculating entities with the button or hotkey will clean these up
Powered_Entities_entity_name_exclusion_list=A list of entity names to exclude from being a powered entity. This is a comma-separated list of the non-localized names of each entity, without spaces or quotes. A single entity does not need a comma. Example: small-lamp,pump
